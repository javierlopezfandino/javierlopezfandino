I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2012, the Master's in Information Technology in 2014 and the PhD. in Computer Science Research in 2018, at the University of Santiago de Compostela. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering.

My lines of research focus on efficient GPU processing of multidimensional remote sensing images. In particular, regarding its classification using neural networks and the change detection in multi-temporal datasets.
